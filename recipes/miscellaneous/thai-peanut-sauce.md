# Thai Peanut Sauce

Be very careful when heating this sauce, as the peanut butter burns easily. If it becomes too thick or separates, just whisk in some water or stock until it is the right consistency. If you have a juicer, you can replace the Vegetable Stock with carrot and celery juice for a deeper, fuller flavour. Stores for up to one week in the fridge.
