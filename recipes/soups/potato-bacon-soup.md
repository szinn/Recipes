# Soup with Potatoes and Bacon

## Ingredients
* 4 big brown potatoes, peeled and cut into small pieces.
* 6 pieces of bacon, cut into small pieces.
* 1 onion of medium size, chopped
* 3 pieces of minced garlic
* 4 cups of chicken or vegetable broth
* 1 cup of heavy cream (or milk for a lighter choice)
* 1 teaspoon of dried thyme (if desired)
* Add salt and pepper according to your preference.
* Sliced green onions or chives, to decorate
* Grated cheddar cheese, to sprinkle on top (if desired)

## Instructions

* In a big pot or a deep pan, cook the diced bacon on medium heat until it is crispy. Take out the bacon and place it on a paper towel to remove excess grease. Keep approximately 2 tablespoons of bacon fat in the pot.

* In the same pot, put the chopped onion and cook until it becomes soft, which should take around 5 minutes. Put the chopped garlic in and cook for one more minute until it smells good.

* Put the chopped potatoes, chicken or vegetable broth, and dried thyme (if you have it) in the pot. Heat until boiling, then lower the heat and let it cook gently until the potatoes are soft, for around 15-20 minutes.

* Use a hand blender to mix the soup until it is smooth. You can also put half of the soup in a blender, blend it until it's smooth, and then pour it back into the pot. (To make it thicker, blend just some of it.)

* Add the heavy cream and season with salt and pepper to your liking. Allow the soup to warm up for an additional 5 minutes.

* Put the soup in bowls and add crispy bacon, chopped green onions or chives, and shredded cheddar cheese if you like.

Ways to serve food:
* This soup goes great with crunchy bread or a basic salad on the side.
* To make it spicier, add a bit of hot sauce or freshly ground black pepper.
* Try this delicious potato and bacon soup that is both creamy and savory, perfect for warming you up.
