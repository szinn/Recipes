# Sizzling Szechuan Chicken Skillet
## Ingredients
* 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, sliced into thin strips
* 2 tbsp vegetable oil
* 1 red bell pepper, sliced
* 1 green bell pepper, sliced
* 1 medium onion, sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1-inch piece ginger, grated
* 2 tbsp Szechuan peppercorns
* 1/4 cup soy sauce
* 2 tbsp rice vinegar
* 1 tbsp hoisin sauce
* 1 tbsp chili paste (adjust to taste)
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/4 cup green onions, chopped
* Cooked rice, for serving

## Instructions
1. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
2. Add the sliced chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.
3. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
4. In the same skillet, add the sliced bell peppers, onion, garlic, and ginger.
5. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp.
6. Stir in the Szechuan peppercorns and cook for an additional minute to release their flavor. 
7. Return the chicken to the skillet and add the soy sauce, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, chili paste, and sugar.
8. Stir well to combine and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
9. Remove from heat and sprinkle with chopped green onions.

Serve hot over cooked rice for a delicious and spicy meal!
