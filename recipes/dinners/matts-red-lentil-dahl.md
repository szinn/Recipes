# Matt's Red Lentil Dahl

## Ingredients

* 1 tbsp Cumin, ground
* 1 tsp Coriander, ground
* 1 tsp Cardamom, ground
* 1 tsp Curry, ground
* 1 tsp black pepper
* 3-4 star anise pods
* 2 cinnamon sticks
* 1 cup diced onions
* 1 cup diced carrots
* 1 cup mushrooms (optional)
* 6 cups vegetable broth
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 cups red lentils (dry)
* 2 cups shredded kale or spinach
* juice and zest of 1 lemon
* 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, diced
* salt to taste

## Instructions

* Cook spices dry in a large/deep frying pan or pot over medium heat for 3-4 minutes until lightly browned and aroma intensifies. Stir often and watch carefully to make sure they do not burn.
* Add onions, carrots, mushrooms (if desired). Cook over medium-high heat, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable broth as needed to prevent sticking. Cook for 3-4 minutes until carrots start to soften.
* Add 6 cups vegetable broth, red lentils, bay leaves, and lemon zest and cook until lentils are soft, 35-45 minutes. Stir in kale, lemon juice and fresh cilantro. Cook 1-2 minutes. Remove bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, and star anise pods.

Serve as-is or over brown basmati rice.
