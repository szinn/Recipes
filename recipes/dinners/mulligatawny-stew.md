# Mulligatawny Stew

## Ingredients
• ½ cup vegetable oil
• 1 cup diced onions
• 2 cup diced carrots
• 1 cup diced celery
• 3 garlic cloves, chopped
• 2 tablespoons minced ginger
• 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander
• 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin
• 1 ½ teaspoons paprika (smoked optional)
• 1 teaspoon turmeric
• 1/4 teaspoon cayenne powder (or less...)
• 2 bay leaves
• 2 cups dried red lentils
• 2-4 cups low-salt chicken broth (start with 2 and see)
• 8 pcs skin on chicken thighs
• 2 x 500ml cans unsweetened coconut milk
• 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
• ¼ bunch of fresh cilantro
• ¼ cup shredded coconut

## Instructions

1. Heat ¼ C oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper on both sides. Carefully place the chicken thighs skin side down in an even layer in the pan. It is important not to over crowd the pan as this will decrease the heat, not provide a crisp caramelized skin, and can lead to the chicken sticking. If needed sear the chicken in batches. Once the chicken has caramelized on the skin side turn it over to seal the flesh side. Remove to a paper towel lined tray.
2. Once all the chicken has been seared, using the same pot you seared the chicken in, heat the remaining oil to medium-high heat. Add the onion, celery, carrot and cook for about 7 to 9 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and yellow, stirring frequently. Add the garlic, ginger, and cook for about 1 minute longer.
3. Add the cumin, coriander, paprika, bay leaves cayenne and lentils. Once you can smell the spices add in the chicken broth (start with 2 cups and see) and bring to a boil. Turn down to a simmer and add in all your chicken thighs skin side up. Cover with a lid. 
4. After 15 mins remove the lid add in the coconut milk and continue to braise the chicken thighs with the lentil and vegetables until the chicken is cooked through. Remove from the chicken from the pot and let cool. 
5. Check the lentils for doneness, adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice. The curry should have a slight hit of heat to it. 
6. Shred or pull the cooked chicken thighs and add meat back into the curry. 
7. Portion the curry into serving bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro and shredded coconut. Serve with Basmati rice as a side.
