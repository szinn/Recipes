# Sausage, Peppers, Onions, and Potatoes in the Oven

## Ingredients

* 1 lb Italian turkey sausage, hot, sweet, or mixed, each cut crosswise into 3 chunks
* 2 large baking (or sweet) potatoes, peeled and each cut into 8 pieces
* 2 large bell peppers, seeded and cut into 1-inch strips
* 2 medium onions, each cut into 8 wedges
* 2 garlic cloves, minced (optional)
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 2 teaspoons dried oregano
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. For easy cleanup, line a large roasting pan (large enough to comfortably fit all the ingredients in a single layer) with aluminum foil
* Place the sausage, potatoes, peppers, onions and garlic (if using) in the pan
* Drizzle the olive oil over the ingredients
* Season with the oregano, salt and pepper
* Toss to coat everything with the oil and seasonings
* Roast in the oven until the potatoes are tender and the sausage is browned, 45 to 60 minutes, stirring the mixture every 20 minutes or so
