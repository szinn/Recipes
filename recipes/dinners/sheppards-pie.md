# Sweet Potato Shepherd's Pie

## Ingredients

* 1½ pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1½-inch chunks (about 2 large potatoes)
* 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, diced
* 2 teaspoons smoked paprika
* Salt and black pepper
* 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 large yellow onion, chopped
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
* ⅛ teaspoon ground cayenne, plus more to taste
* 3 large garlic cloves, minced 
* 1 pound ground lamb (or beef)
* 1 (15-ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed
* ½ cup pitted dates, chopped
* 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, plus more for serving
* 2 tablespoons tomato paste
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* 1 cup beef broth

## Instructions

* Bring a large pot of water to a boil over medium-high heat. Add the sweet potatoes and cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until fork tender. Drain, then return the potatoes to the pot and cook over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, until any remaining moisture has evaporated. Using a potato masher, mash the potatoes until smooth. Add the butter and ½ teaspoon of the paprika; mix until smooth. Season to taste with salt.
* Meanwhile, heat the oven to 375 degrees and make the filling: In a large (12-inch) skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-low. Add the onion, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne and the remaining 1½ teaspoons paprika, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and lightly browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
* Increase the heat to medium-high and add the lamb. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon, until browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the chickpeas, dates and parsley. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until it’s incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Sprinkle on the flour and cook until no more flecks of flour are visible, about 1 minute. Add the broth and cook over medium-low, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.
* Transfer the filling to a 9-inch or other 2-quart baking dish with 2-inch sides. Dollop spoonfuls of the mashed sweet potatoes on top, covering the surface, then use a spatula to spread them into an even layer.
* Bake, uncovered, for 25 to 30 minutes, until the filling is bubbling up around the edges of the pan. To brown the top slightly, broil on high for 2 minutes, watching carefully. Cool for 15 minutes, then serve, garnished with more parsley.
