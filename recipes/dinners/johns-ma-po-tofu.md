# John's Ma Po Tofu

## Ingredients

* 200-400g ground pork
* peanut oil
* 3-4 cloves chopped garlic
* 1-2" of fresh ginger root, peeled and finely minced
* 1 tsp sambal olek
* handful of shredded szechuan preserved vegetable (cans at chinese grocery store, drained)
* 1 1/2-2 cups chicken stock
* generous dollop of soy sauce
* 1 pkg each of silken and firm tofu, cubed
* green onions, chopped (for garnish)
* 3-4 tbsp sesame oil

## Instructions

* Prep/chop all ingredients first
* In a wok or large pot on high heat, fry ground pork in peanut oil with salt and pepper until starting to brown
* add garlic and ginger
* add sambal olek (or sriracha, hot bean paste, chili oil or similar)
* add shredded szechuan preserved vegetable
* add chicken stock
* add soy sauce. The stock should change color and be a bit salty. Adjust saltiness to taste. It's OK if it's a touch too salty at this point. It mellows when you add the tofu later.
