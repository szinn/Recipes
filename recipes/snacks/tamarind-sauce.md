# Tamarind Sauce

## Ingredients

* 200g block of tamarind pulp
* water to cover 1 1/2 cups plus more if preferred
* 1 tsp cumin powder
* 1 tsp chaat masala (optional)
* 1/2 tsp dried ginger powder
* 1/2 tsp red chili powder or to taste
* 1 tsp sugar or jaggery - to taste
* salt to taste

## Instructions

1. break up block of tamarind into about six pieces in a small saucepan and cover with 375ml water. Bring to a rolling simmer over medium-high heat, stirring often for about 5 minutes. Then remove and let cool for 5 minutes.
2. Use wooden spoon or masher to smash the tamarind in the water. The sauce will become thick like ketchup. Run through a sieve into a bowl, pushing against the solids as you do. You should end up with a thick tamarind paste
3. Return tamarind paste to saucepan and add the cumin, chaat masala, ginger, chili powder and sugar. Bring to a simmer for about 3 minutes until the sugar is completely dissolved. You can add a drop more water if preferred.
4. Add sugar / salt to taste.
