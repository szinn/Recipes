# Sugar Nuts

## Ingredients

* 6 cups raw nuts - almonds, Brazil nuts, hazelnuts, pecans, walnuts, Macadamias
* 1 cup sugar
* One cup maple syrup
* 1.5 tbsp cinnamon (maybe 2)
* 1.5 tsp ginger (maybe 2)
* 1/4 tsp salt

## Instructions

* First, toast the nuts
  * Almonds I toss in a little coconut oil and roast at 350Â°F until fragrant
  * Hazelnuts I toast dry until fragrant, then rub them between my hands vigorously to remove some of the skins
  * Chop the Brazil nuts into Macadamia size pieces, and roast those very briefly (the high fat content means they burn super fast, and they continue to toast a bit in the sugaring step)
  * Walnuts and pecans toast at a similar rate as the Brazils and Macadamias
* Then you add the nuts, sugar, syrup and spices to a big heavy bottomed pot and put on med low heat
* Stir fairly constantly (more important as time goes on and the sugar/nuts are of a temperature to burn) until the sugar coating looks dry instead of syrupy
* Spread out on parchment lined cookie sheets to cool
