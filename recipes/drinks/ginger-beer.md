# Ginger Beer

(Linda Milsom’s version)

## The Bug

## Ingredients

* 1-2 cups warm water
* 1/4 tsp granulated yeast
* juice of one lemon
* 2 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp powdered ginger

## Instructions

* mix ingredients in a jar with a lid
* allow to “work'“ for 15 minutes and then “feed” add 2 tsp of sugar and 2 tsp of ginger.
* continue to “feed” every other day for a week to ten days
* keep covered, but not sealed

## The Juice

In a large bowl mix:

* enough water to fill six 1.25L bottles to just below the shoulder
* 2-3 cups of sugar
* juice of 2-3 lemons (or 4-5 if you have lots of lemons) Could use lime
* strained liquid from the “Bug” using muslin or tea towel

Mix thoroughly then bottle. Leave an air gap at the top of the bottle. Firmly screw on the cap and leave for at least a week before opening (carefully!) but no more than 3 weeks.

Add a cup of water to the “bug” solids in the jar, feed with sugar and ginger and then begin the process again.

Discard some of the solids every two weeks or so when it becomes too much.
