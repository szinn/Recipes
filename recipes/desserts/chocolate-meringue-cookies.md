# Chocolate Meringue Cookies

Makes: 60 to 70 cookies

Prep Time: 10 minutes

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup semisweet or milk chocolate chips
* 3 large egg whites, at room temperature
* 1/3 cup sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

* Preheat the oven to 250Â°F
* Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper and set them aside
* Place the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe dish and microwave, uncovered, on high power for 1 minute
* Remove the chips from the microwave and stir until they are completely melted. Set aside
* Using an electric mixer, beat the egg whites on medium speed until soft peaks form, about 1 minute
* With the mixer running, slowly add the sugar
* Increase the mixer speed to high and beat until the egg whites are stiff but not dry, about 1 minute
* Using a spoon or a spatula, gently fold the chocolate and the vanilla into the egg whites
* Spoon the mixture into a pint-size zipper-top plastic bag and seal the bag
* Use scissors to cut a small opening in one corner of the bag
* Squirt the meringue onto the parchment paper in bite-size dollops.
* Bake for 1 hour

Remove the cookies from the over and allow them to cool completely on the cookie sheets, about 30 minutes. Then peel them off the parchment and serve at once or store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks.
