# Almond Biscotti

## Ingredients

* 7oz (1 1/3 cups) whole almonds, skin on
* 11oz (2 3/4 cups) unbleached all-purpose flour
* 1 2/3 cups sugar
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp aniseed
* grated zest of 1 lemon, 1 lime, 1 orange
* 3 large eggs plus 3 egg yolks
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Instructions

* Heat the oven to 350°F and toast the almonds on a baking sheet for 10 to 15 min until they emit a nutty aroma but haven't turned dark brown inside.  Let cool
* Put the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, aniseed, and grated zests into the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle and combine on medium-low speed
* In a separate bowl, lightly beat together the eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla extract with a whisk
* With the mixer running, pour the egg mixture into the mixing bowl
* When the egg mixture is almost completely incorporated, reduce the speed to low, add the almonds and mix just until the dough comes together.  Do not overmix
* Dump the dough onto a lightly floured work surface, and knead in by hand any remaining dry ingredients from the bottom of the bowl
* Divide the dough into three equal parts
* With floured hands, roll each part into a log about 10in. long and 2in. in diameter
* Place the logs 4in. apart on greased or parchment-lined baking sheets
* Bake the logs at 350°F for about 45 min until they're light brown but still soft
* Remove the baking sheet from the oven and reduce the oven temperature to 300°F
* Let the logs cool on the baking sheet for at least 10 min before slicing
* Cut the logs on a slight diagonal into 3/4 in thick biscotti
* Place the biscotti flat on the baking sheet and dry them in the oven for 10 to 15 min until the biscotti offer resistance when pressed, but the cut side hasn't begun to darken
* Transfer the biscotti to a rack to cool
