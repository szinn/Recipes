# Gluten-free Banana Muffins

## Ingredients

* 2 small bananas
* 1/2 cup sugar
* 1/4 cup oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla
* 2 eggs
* 1 1/4 cup oat flour
* 1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon xanthum gun (or guar gum)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

* Preheat over to 350Â°F
* Lightly grease an 8" square baking pan or muffin cups
* In a large bowl, mash the bananas well. This is easier to do with a mixer
* Add all the other ingredients and mix well. The batter will thicken as it is mixed
* Pour into the prepared pan
* Bake for approximately 30 minutes, until a toothpick inserted in the middle tests cleanly

The baking time for muffins is a little less.
